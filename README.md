 Python Implementation of the Pepp*erdine Esoteric Programming Language
 Code is mostly from https://github.com/kosayoda/chickenpy/

 Pepp*erdine is a language in which the only valid tokens are "pep", "erdine", "\n", and concatenations of 'p' with itself. 
 'pep' is the start command, 'erdine' is the halt command. Each line of a .ppd program corresponds to an opcode denoted
 by the number of 'p' characters in that line. This is directly analogous to the Chicken esolang by Torbjörn Söderstedt.
